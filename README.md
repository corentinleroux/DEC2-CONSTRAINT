# DEC2-CONSTRAINT - M2IKSEM

## Part 1 - Programming Exercices 

Here is all the development exercices for my homework of DEC2-Constraint.


- [README of the exercise : N-Queens](https://github.com/corentinleroux/dec2-constraint/tree/main/N-Queens)
- [README of the exercise : TWO + TWO = FOUR](https://github.com/corentinleroux/dec2-constraint/tree/main/TWO)
- [README of the exercise : Magic Square](https://github.com/corentinleroux/dec2-constraint/tree/main/Square)


## Part 2 : Modeling Exercices 

We had to model all the problem that follow as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (or Combinatorial Optimisation Problems if applicable).

1. SEND + MORE = MONEY
2. 4-queens, generalize to N-queens
3. Magic squares N
4. Vending machine
5. Stable matching
