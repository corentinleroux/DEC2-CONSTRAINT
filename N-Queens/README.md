# DEC2-CONSTRAINT - M2IKSEM

Here is my exercise for N-Queens problem.

## Description

## Questions

1. Is it **easy** to program ? 
> 
2. Can it be **generalized** (for arbitrary size of problems) ? 
> 
3. Is it **efficient** ? Does it **scale well** (in terms of executions) ? 
>  
4. Measure execution time for different size problems.
