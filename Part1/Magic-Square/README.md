# DEC2-CONSTRAINT - M2IKSEM

Here is my exercise for N-Square problem. There is 2 codes : 

- **N-Square.ipynb** to allow the user to unter his own value (must be odd)
- **N-SquareForTesting.ipynb** to test execution time (turned the code as a function)

## Description

## Questions

1. Is it **easy** to program ? 
> The problem is quite simple to with numpy if we have the math aspect of each conditions.  

2. Can it be **generalized** (for arbitrary size of problems) ? 
> The code is generelized to N-square and optimized in terms of efficiency. 
 
3. Is it **efficient** ? Does it **scale well** (in terms of executions) ? 
>  Yes, it is. This code provide a really good execution time. 

4. Measure execution time for different size problems.
> If you run the **N-SquareForTesting**, you will see that it always takes less than 1 second to execute the code.
