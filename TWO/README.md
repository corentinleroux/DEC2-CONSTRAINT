# DEC2-CONSTRAINT - M2IKSEM

Here is my exercise TWO + TWO = FOUR.

## Description

I used Python for my script and the library "time" to check the execution time of my code. 

1. Random Solution (1 Solution Two.py)

I first tried to generate fast a random solution : 

![Resultat 1](https://github.com/corentinleroux/DEC2-CONSTRAINT/blob/main/TWO/Img/Capture%20d’écran%202022-02-10%20à%2009.06.09.png?raw=true)

But then i wanted a solution that is able to display all the solutions :

![Solution 2](https://github.com/corentinleroux/DEC2-CONSTRAINT/blob/main/TWO/Img/Capture%20d’écran%202022-02-10%20à%2009.06.45.png?raw=true)

We can see that i decided to not write each conditions like T!=W & T!=O & T!=F and so on because i thought it was not really responsive in case i wanted to code the SEND+MORE=MONEY or any other problem of that kind. So i decided to create a list and to compare the size of the list with the size of unique value of the list. If its not the same, than it is not a solution. 

![Resultat 2](https://github.com/corentinleroux/DEC2-CONSTRAINT/blob/main/TWO/Img/Capture%20d’écran%202022-02-10%20à%2009.06.58.png?raw=true)

As we can see, it take much more time to run (mostly because of the list and because of all the print) but is more complete.
